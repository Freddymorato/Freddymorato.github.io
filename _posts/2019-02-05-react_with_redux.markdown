After finishing my final project on React with Redux, I have changed my opinion on using these tools. 
My first impression of React was that it is a bit confusing, it's like one big component jigjigsaw puzzle. I also thought Redux to be a bit overwhelming. But, as I started working on my final project, I became more comfortable with the two. Once, the pieces began to fall into place I realized the power of these tools. How they make apps fast and efficient. It's truly beautiful. I look forward to using React with Redux again in the future.
