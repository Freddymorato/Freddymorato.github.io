This project has been a fun and challenging one. Before starting this assigment I reviewed many past lessons, as I often do throughout the curriculum, in order to ensure I fully understood the past concepts necessary for this new challenge. There were a few times during the development of this gem where I got stuck. The most challenging part of this project was definitely coding the scraper class. It took a good deal of time to figure out the right selectors. Eventually through persistance and patience things began to fall into place, and I couldn't be happier with the result! 

I built a CLI gem that scrapes the website http://dogtime.com/ for information on different dog breeds. The gem displays this information and allowes for user interaction through it's interface. 

I'm looking forward to tackling the next project.
