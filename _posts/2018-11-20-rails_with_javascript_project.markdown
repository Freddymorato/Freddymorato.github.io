This was the most fun project so far. Finally getting to apply all the the knowledge on DOM manipulation to my Rails project was really satisfying. I decided that for this project I would add the ability of rendering comments for hiking trails on the trail show page. On the same page I'm also able to submit new comments, all without refreshing the page. Working on this project really solidified my understanding of Jquery and it's efficiency. I look forward to using it again in future projects.
