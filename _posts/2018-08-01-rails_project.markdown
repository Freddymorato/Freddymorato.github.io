Another project completed, and many lessons learned. I am happy with my project. Iâ€™m happy with how it looks and the overall way that the app functions. But if I had more time I would like to add more features to it. 

This project taught me a lot. Like how to use gem 'carrierwave' , to allow the user to upload a file. Or the gem 'flag-icon-sass, which cotains flag icons of every country. Also, the 'bootstrap-social-rails', which has icons for social media login. The list goes on and on.  

The app I created is a hiking trail library of sorts. A user can log in and share information about dangerous hiking trails from around the world. You can signup either by creating a username and password or through facebook.

If you would like to see a walkthrough of the app here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqHAs1DgVAI&t=11s
