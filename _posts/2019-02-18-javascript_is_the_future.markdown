JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages out there, and it is probably one of the easiest to get into as well. Its popularity is only growing. It is regarded by many as the best or “proper” way to do web development.

These are some of the reasons why JS is so popular: 

1. Simple — JavaScript has become so widespread because, fore-mostly, it’s easy to learn! It’s a syntactically simple language and also has a huge open source community to seek out help from in case you get stuck.

2. Extensible — JavaScript can be coupled with many powerful tools that give it a ton of utility: JSON, AJAX, Nodejs, MongoDB, jQuery. These tools take this “messy” looking language to the next level. Nodejs/MongoDB allows for it to be used as a backend language, AJAX gives it optimized loading times and a fabulous user experience, and jQuery gives it an extnesive code library that makes writing complex Javascript much quicker/easier. The tools it can harness are many and powerful in their own right.

3. Accessible — Runs in a browser so you don’t need to download it in order to use it. All you need is a text editor. Also, it’s supported by pretty much any browser out there, giving developers the confidence that they’re code will work, no matter what computer it’s on.

4. Flexible — JavaScript is the ONLY language you can use to build an entire website, can be used both to create the user interface side which deals with the look and feel of the site(Front End) and the server side which deals with information storage and databases(Back End). Also it’s what makes a site interactive and basically transformed the internet by adding this functionality. Now it’s ubiquitous with the internet and used on nearly EVERY website out there.
