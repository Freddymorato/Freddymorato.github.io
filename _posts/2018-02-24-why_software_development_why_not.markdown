"Growing up I was very into computers, I liked learning about basic computer maintenence and operations. I also loved playing MMORPG's and first person shooters. But I was also a bit of a jock, I took part in many sports teams (mostly soccer). With regards to software engineering, it wasn't until I started college when I wrote my first few lines of HTML in my web design class that I realized coding was for me. I've now developed a passion for this field and have made a decision to push myself as hard as I can to grow into the best developer I can be."
