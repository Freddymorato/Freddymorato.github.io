First off, I'd like to point out that the preparation leading up to this project was very well  designed. All the labs and lessons did just want they were meant to: teach about the structure of an app, how to set up the controllers, the views, models, and database. How to get all the gears turning and working together!

Learning how all the diferent parts of an app communicate with eachother, exchanging information whilst taking user input and producing an output is a wild ride. It's truly magical what goes on under the hood, and onece you've learned how to control it, manipulate it, and enhance it you become limitless! Sinatra is definitely an exceptional manual and light-weight framework to get started on when building your first MVC application. I really enjoyed the whole Sinatra section, especially this final project assigmnet. 

I built an app called Soccer Training Tracker which basically allowes you to keep a record of all your favorite training drills, as well as drills from other players and coaches. I really enjoyed this assigment, especially the styling process!
