<p>I'm currently finishing my bachelors in front-end web development at CUNY City Tech in Brooklyn, NY. It was during the beginning of my degree when I had my first experiences writing basic HTML that I decided coding was for me. Since then I have developed an appetite for learning more and more about coding. That is why I decided to join Flatiron so that I could learn the back-end site of web development. So far I have really enjoyed this course. My plan is to take more courses like this in the future, and just keep on learning and growing until the end of my days. =) </p>
